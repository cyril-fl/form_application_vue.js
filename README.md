# Application Form

## Description
As part of my final internship at BeCode, I have the opportunity to explore Vue.js. This project represents my first approach to this technology that I am not yet familiar with. The goal is to create a form that allows managing applications for internships.

## Features
- **Application Form**: Allows entering various data on applications submitted to facilitate the display of many internships.
- **Display Table**: Shows the entered data in an organized manner for easy tracking.

## Technologies
- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework used to build the user interface.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool for fast and efficient development.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application information.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
