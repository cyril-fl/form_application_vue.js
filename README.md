- **Table**: Displays the previously registered data in an organized manner for easy tracking.

### Technologies
#### Frontend
- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development experience.
#### Backend

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.

### Honorable Mentions
